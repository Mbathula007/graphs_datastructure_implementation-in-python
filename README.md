# graphs_datastructure_implementation-in-python
In this repository i have implemented basic graph datastructure using adjacency list
# contains functions such as 
# insert an element into graph
# getting neighbours of a node (adj function)
# searching bfs (breadth first search)
# DFS
# Topological Sorting
